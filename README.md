------

This makes many electrical machines use minimum possible power (1 watt or user defined) when not in use. In addition, many electrical machines from other mods should behave the same way.

If you think this mod makes stuff easy you can set multipliers so when the machine is used they can use more power than normal.

However, please note that due to the way Rimworld works, if your base keeps wavering between a small amount of power and no power, pawns may go back and forth to a station, trying to use it when the power comes back on, then leaving when the power flickers back off.

Fully save compatible. Can be added or removed at any time. Please report any errors.
